**Verdict:** In favour of the topic - AI LLMs should be responsible

**Reason:** While the arguments against assigning responsibility to AI LLMs highlight significant practical challenges—defining responsibility, the chilling effect on innovation, global jurisdictional issues, and the difficulty of proving harm—the arguments in favor are ultimately more compelling.  The potential for widespread harm from misinformation, bias, discrimination, and manipulation caused by LLMs is undeniable and demands a robust response.  Focusing solely on human responsibility is insufficient, as it fails to address the systemic issues embedded within LLMs themselves.  A framework for LLM responsibility, while complex to establish, is crucial for driving ethical development, promoting transparency, fostering trust, and incentivizing best practices.  The arguments against often focus on potential drawbacks without offering equally compelling alternative solutions for mitigating the substantial risks posed by powerful, widely-deployed LLMs.  The challenges of implementation do not negate the moral imperative to address the potential for serious harm.  The long-term goal should be to develop a framework that balances the need for responsible development with the fostering of innovation, though this will undoubtedly require considerable effort and international cooperation.
